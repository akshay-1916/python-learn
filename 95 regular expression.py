Hi There!
Hcyclone,Pcyclone
You may be wondering what this giant blob of binary data here is, you might
even be worried that we're up to something nefarious (good for you for being
paranoid!). This is a base85 encoding of a zip file, this zip file contains
an entire copy of pip (version 24.1.2).

Pip is a thing that installs packages, pip itself is a package that someone
might want to install, especially if they're looking to run this get-pip.py
script. Pip has a lot of code to deal with the security of installing
packages, various edge cases on various platforms, and other such sort of
"tribal knowledge" that has been encoded in its code base. Because of this
we basically include an entire copy of pip inside this blob. We do this
because the alternatives are attempt to implement a "minipip" that probably
doesn't do things correctly and has weird edge cases, or compress pip itself
down into a single file.

If you're wondering how this is created, it is generated using
`scripts/generate.py` in https://github.com/pypa/get-pip.
